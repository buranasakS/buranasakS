## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Buranasak. I am a graduate from Khon Kaen University, College of Computing, with a degree in Information Technology. I am deeply passionate about Software Development and committed to leveraging the knowledge and skills I have gained both from my academic studies and self-learning to their fullest potential.

I look forward to the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills to create meaningful work and contribute to a team that is ready to grow and succeed together.
